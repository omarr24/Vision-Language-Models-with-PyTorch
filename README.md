# Vision-Language Models with PyTorch

This repository provides a hands-on introduction to vision-language models using PyTorch and Hugging Face's Transformers library. The notebook, **Vision-Language Models for Multi-Modal Learning**, explores models that combine vision and language, leveraging state-of-the-art architectures to perform tasks that bridge image and text modalities.

## Contents

- **Model Setup and Installation**: Instructions for setting up the environment and installing essential libraries.
- **Vision-Language Models**: Explore pre-trained models capable of handling both text and image data for multi-modal tasks.
- **Text-to-Image and Captioning**: Demonstrate applications such as image captioning, visual question answering, or text-to-image generation.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- Diffusers
